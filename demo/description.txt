Persuading people in South Tyrol to switch to public or muscle-driven mobility  

Description
===========

Motivation: South Tyrol is not excluded from global warming. The climate report "SÃ¼dtirol 2018" confirms that it is crucial to reduce emissions, created by transport and tourism. 

Problem statement: The goal of this project is to propose a timetable information system with route planning, which is able to suggest to the user alternative, sustainable ways to reach a particular destination.

Approach: Our approach is self monitoring (showing one's own CO2 consumption data), challenges (daily, weekly,and monthly goals), goal setting (setting targets for CO2 saving), social comparison (comparing one's own performance with others), and personalized suggestions for commuters and tourists. Particularly the last aspect is innovative: the same route is offered in various combinations with different CO2 impacts. Moreover, the user is furthermore persuaded showing money savings when using public or muscle-driven mobility. In addition, the data obtained from monitoring what the user actually chooses (based on his movements) can by used by other stakeholders for their decision making.

Results: The result of this hackaton is the design and the UI of the features described above. Moreover, the proof of concept contains the necessary code to obtain data from the South Tyrolan Open Data Hub and the Open Street Map. The latter is used to classify the routes on which the user is moving and to predict the CO2 impact. 

Conclusions: The developed proof of concept demonstrates that the idea is feasible. To estimate the CO2 impact, a user study is needed to evaluate the acceptance of such tool. We estimate the development effort of the here described tool as 12 person months.
